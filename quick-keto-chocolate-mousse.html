        <p>
            This keto chocolate mousse is perfect when a sweet craving hits. 
            It's so quick it will be ready in no time. 
            No need to pre-whip the heavy cream — 
            just throw everything into a bowl and mix! 
            Use any keto-friendly granular sweetener that measures like sugar.
             I prefer the powdered version of Swerve, since it dissolves better. 
             Adjust cocoa powder and sweetener amounts to suit your tastes. 
             This is quite rich, so you don't need a lot to feel satisfied.

            It can be hard to satisfy your sweet tooth while staying true to the keto diet. 
            That's where this keto chocolate mousse comes in! The light and airy dessert is low-carb, 
            easy to throw together quickly, and absolutely delicious.

            What makes this chocolate mousse keto?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Most people who follow the keto diet avoid sugar, as sugar contains carbs. 
            So, instead of the white sugar that's traditionally used in chocolate mousse, 
            this recipe calls for powdered zero-calorie sweetener.
