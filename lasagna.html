        <ul>
            <li>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong>
                <p>An onion and two cloves of garlic 
                    are cooked with the meat 
                    to add tons of flavor.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tomato products:</strong>
                <p>
                    You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, 
                    two cans of tomato sauce, 
                    and two cans of tomato paste.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sugar:</strong>
                <p>
                    Two tablespoons of white sugar
                    add subtle sweetness 
                    and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong>
                <p>
                    This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, 
                    dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, 
                    fennel seeds, and black pepper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>
                <p>
                    Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cheeses</strong>
                <p>
                    Parmesan, mozzarella, 
                    and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Egg</strong>
                <p>
                    An egg helps bind the ricotta 
                    so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna 
                    when you cut into it.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
